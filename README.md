Recommendation system with MovieLens dataset

Build a matrix factorization (MF) model and a neural network (NN) model in Keras and train them using GPU. Test these models using the well-known dataset MovieLens 1m. The MF model beats the state-of-the-art with a big margin. The NN model also performs better than state-of-the-art, and is moreover trained faster than the MF model.
